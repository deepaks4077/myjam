# myjam
Web application built on Angular.js and Node.js that makes it easier to host a house-party!

The initial front-end is based on JukeTube[jgthms.com/juketube]. Will change that to use Polymer.js 

The app can currently

  1. Search for youtube videos
  2. Add/Queue videos 
  3. Queue videos from History

Please add your own youtube data key in youtubeService.js to search youtube.
